We first brought level 0 code to level 1 using our previous code with slight modifications. 

1)  ast.hh and ast.cc
	-> wrote function to generate spim code for all the Ast
	-> wrote code to implement lra tag for Relational Expression, Goto and If_Else Statement

3)	reg-alloc.hh and reg-alloc.cc
	-> updated Stmt classes to generate spim code for corresponding statements
	-> updated code to implement lra tag for Relation Expression

Corner cases handled :
	-> lra implementation has been handled with care in case of assignment statements, for eg. case when rhs of assignment is a Relation Expression is handled separately
